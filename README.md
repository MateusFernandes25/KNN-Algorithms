# KNN-Algorithms

KNN is a non-parametric and lazy learning algorithm. Non-parametric means there is no assumption for underlying data distribution. In other words, the model structure determined from the dataset. This will be very helpful in practice where most of the real world datasets. This repository is a implementing KNN algorithm in manual form.
